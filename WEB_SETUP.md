# Web Setup Documentation

## Overview
This project consists of a React frontend (compiled with Vite) and a Laravel backend. The web root is configured to serve the compiled frontend files while maintaining API access to the Laravel backend.

## Directory Structure
- `web/` - React frontend source code
- `web/dist/` - Compiled frontend files (generated by `npm run build`)
- `backend/` - Laravel backend
- `backend/public/` - Web root directory (serves both frontend and API)

## Build Process
1. Navigate to the `web/` directory
2. Run `npm run build` to compile the frontend
3. The compiled files are automatically copied to `backend/public/`

## File Permissions
- Files: 644 (rw-r--r--)
- Directories: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
- These permissions ensure security while allowing web server access

## Web Server Configuration
The `.htaccess` file in `backend/public/` is configured to:
- Serve static files directly
- Route `/api/*` requests to Laravel backend
- Serve the frontend `index.html` for all other routes
- Include security headers
- Block access to sensitive files

## Security Features
- Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Blocked access to sensitive file types (.env, .log, .sql, etc.)
- Proper file permissions
- API routes protected and routed to Laravel

## Deployment
The web root directory is set to `backend/public/`, which contains:
- Compiled frontend files (index.html, assets/)
- Laravel backend files (index.php)
- Security configuration (.htaccess)

## Testing
- Frontend: Access the root URL to see the React application
- API: Access `/api/*` routes to interact with the Laravel backend
- Static files: Assets are served directly from the assets/ directory
